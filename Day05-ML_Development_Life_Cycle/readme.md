# Today's Learnings
## Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC)
### 1. Frame the Problem
  - Understand your problem statement and think accordingly.
### 2. Data Gathering
  - Problem specific data must be collected.
  - It must relevant to the requirements.
  - Can be of any format (like csv, APIs, web scrapping, etc.)
### 3. Data Preprocessing
  - Process of cleaning data, removing/adjusting missing values, etc.
  - Structing it in such way that it'll help model to derive outcomes efficiently.
  - One of the most important step in MLDLC because is affects the model performance.
### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Creating some visualizations to understand the data distribution.
  - Also helps to understand the behaviour of given data.
  - Used to determine what analysis to perform (eg. univariate, bivariate, multivariate).
### 5. Feature Engineering
  - It's a process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data.
  - Making effective changes in features.
  - Steps involved:
    - *Feature Transformation*
    - *Feature Construction*
    - *Feature Selection*
    - *Feature Extraction*
### 6. Model Training and Evaluation
  - Training data using various ML models based on various algorithms.
  - Evaluating based suitable model with accuracy score.
  - Also involves *Ensemble Learning*, means merging/deriving new algorithsm using 2 or more ML algorithms to create new efficient one.
### 7. Model Deployment
  - Process of converting the model to software for UI and making it usable for clients/users.
### 8. Testing and Optimize
  - After collecting and determining the bugs and errors in model deployment making changes and improving it's performance for better experience.
