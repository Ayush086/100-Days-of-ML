***ML models learning algorithms technique***

## Instance Based Learning
  - Systems that learn the training examples by heart and then generalize to new instances based on some similarity measure.
  - *When Query is asked*, model trained with instance based learning compare values with training data and give results.
  - More similar values will be picked from training examples.
  - Models doesn't **analyze** provided data.
  - eg. KNN

    
## Model Based Learning
  - Models try to understand the behaviour of the provided data. (finds patterns, mathematical relations, etc.)
  - In ML, models underlying in this categroy are used mostly.
  - Once trained then there is not need to train during deployment(execution).
  - eg. LogisticRegression
