# Today's Learnings
I exploreed the various types of Machine Learning.
Mainly categorised into 4 parts:
## 1.  Supervised Learning 
  - Machines learns from example by i/p and o/p mappings.
  - input and output is present in dataset.
  - Mainly used for prediction and classification
### Types
#### Regression
  - Predicting a number from infinitely possible outcomes
  - Numerical o/p

#### Classification
  - Very few outcomes are possible (generally 2) and they get splitted as problems gets more specific
  - Categorical o/p (eg. boolean value)

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
  - Learning on their own
  - Data isn't labeled, machine finds hidden patterns/algorithms from the unlabelled data.
### Types
#### Clustering
  - Grouping data with similar categories together and dividing them up in small sub-groups with more familiar properties.

#### Dimensionality Reduction
  - here dimension is more likely to be dependency.
  - It's more like a compression, didn't understood well.
  - But according to me, decreasing the dimensions of the data to get more relevant output.

#### Anamoly Detection
  - Unusal pattern and outliers detection in data.
  - generally used for threat detection and disease detection using image processing.

## 3. Semi-supervised Learning
  - Rarely used
  - Data isn't prepared correctly, some data is missing and few is unlabelled and very few are labelled properly.

## 4. Reinforcement Learning
  - No data is feed.
  - Learns by their own.
  - Learn from experience.
  - The more you train it, the more precise results you'll get.
