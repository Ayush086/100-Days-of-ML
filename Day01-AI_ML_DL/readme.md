# Today's Learnings
I learnt about difference between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML)
*Many of us get confused when all 3 fields are discussed simultaneously, until a brief about each field is known*

## Artificial Intelligence
  -  It's nothing but a human trying to make a man-made intelligence which works just like our brain

## Machine Learning
  - Making machines to achieve AI's goals by using various mathematical algorithms
    
## Deep Learning
  - It's more specific ML field in which we employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to perform complex tasks by automatically detecting patterns present in the data and generating their own algorithm based on it.
